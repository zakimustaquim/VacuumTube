VacuumTube is an unofficial wrapper of YouTube Leanback (the console and Smart TV version of YouTube) for the desktop, with a built-in adblocker and minor enhancements.

## What exactly is this?

It is **not** a custom client, YouTube Leanback is an official interface. This project simply encompasses it and makes it usable as a standalone desktop application.

YouTube Leanback is just an HTML5 app, and so you *can* just use it in your browser by going to https://www.youtube.com/tv, but they intentionally block browsers unless it's one of their console or TV apps.

You can technically bypass this by spoofing your user agent, but it isn't the same experience you'd get on a console or TV as it doesn't support controllers outside of the official app, and it's just a much more involved process to get it working.

VacuumTube solves all of this by wrapping it with Electron, pretending to be the YouTube app, implementing controller *and* touch support, and overall making it a much better experience than just spoofing your user agent.

If there's anything that you think makes it look lazy or half-baked, open an issue! The goal is to make it feel as official as possible, while also providing niceties like ad blocking, DeArrow and userstyles.

## Installing

### Windows

If you don't know the difference, pick the Installer.

- [Installer](https://github.com/shy1132/VacuumTube/releases/latest/download/VacuumTube-Setup.exe)
- Portable:
  - [x64 / amd64](https://github.com/shy1132/VacuumTube/releases/latest/download/VacuumTube-x64-Portable.zip)
  - [Arm® 64](https://github.com/shy1132/VacuumTube/releases/latest/download/VacuumTube-arm64-Portable.zip)

### macOS

Note that macOS builds are not yet signed, so they do not auto-update. For now, please periodically check for updates.

- [Universal](https://github.com/shy1132/VacuumTube/releases/latest/download/VacuumTube-universal.dmg)

### Linux

In most cases, you very likely want to use the [Flatpak](https://flathub.org/apps/rocks.shy.VacuumTube), which works across all distributions and common architectures.

Otherwise, you can use a distribution package or a portable one. If you don't know the difference, you likely want amd64.

## Extra Input Mappings

VacuumTube exposes a few extra input mappings for actions that may be desired on a desktop:

- `Ctrl+O` or `R3`
  - Open VacuumTube Settings
- `Ctrl+Shift+C`
  - Copy current video URL to clipboard
- `Shift+Enter`
  - Simulate long-press of the Enter key
- `Right Click`
  - Go back
- `+`
  - Increase volume
- `-`
  - Decrease volume
- `M`
  - Toggle mute
- `]` or `>`
  - Increase playback speed
- `[` or `<`
  - Decrease playback speed
- `\`
  - Reset playback speed to `1x`

## Custom CSS (Userstyles)

You can apply custom styles to VacuumTube by first enabling it in the settings, and then creating `.css` files in the userstyles folder. They can then be managed in VacuumTube settings. You can access the developer tools by pressing **Ctrl+Shift+I**, which are extremely helpful when writing custom CSS.

The userstyles folder is located in the config folder mentioned below.

## Command Line Flags

You can provide extra command line flags to Chromium via the `flags.txt` file located in the config folder.

For example, putting `--disable-gpu` into the `flags.txt` file will cause VacuumTube to run with the GPU disabled. You can find more flags by searching for Chromium command line flags, but you likely won't need to mess with this.

## Config Folder

Your config folder is located at:

- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\VacuumTube\`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/VacuumTube/`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/VacuumTube/`
- **Linux (Flatpak)**: `~/.var/app/rocks.shy.VacuumTube/config/VacuumTube/`
